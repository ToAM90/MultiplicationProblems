# MultiplicationProblems

Multiplication Practice Application

When the application loads, the user is given a problem set with ten multiplication problems. As the user makes a choice from the four possible answers, the score and problem's solved is updated accordingly. At any time during the problem set, the user can start over by clicking "Start Over."

Once the user finishes all ten questions, a summary screen will be displayed. 

Future plans for this project is to allow the user to choose other forms of Mathematical operations, such as Addition, Subtraction, and Division.
